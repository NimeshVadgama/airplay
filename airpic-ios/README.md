AirPic Demo
===========

This is a MonoTouch / C# sample for using the ``Poupou.AirPlay.dll`` assembly. 
It's also a sample on how to use iOS6 new ``UIActivity`` with a MonoTouch application.

The application simply shows an image (see credits) and let you send it to any, non password-protected, AirPlay device (e.g. an AppleTV) on your network.

I found this useful (for my own needs) and there were no API in iOS to send pictures (only video and sounds) without the use of any private/undocumented API (which I rather avoid).
